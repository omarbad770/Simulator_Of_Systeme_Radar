# Simulator_Of_Systeme_Radar
"In this project, I'm developing a sea radar simulator using Python, machine learning techniques (including neural networks, random forests, logistic regression, and SVM), and a database. The simulator will mimic the functionality of a real sea radar, detecting and tracking objects on the water.
